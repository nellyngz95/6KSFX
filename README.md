Procedural audio, a method of generating sound from scratch using computational processes, offers a promising approach to creating sound effects, often referred to as "digital Foley". Despite its potential, research and optimisation of procedural audio has been limited by a lack of publicly available samples and models. This paper presents a dataset of synthetic audio samples designed to advance research in sound synthesis. By providing access to different synthesis methods and facilitating the development of evaluation techniques, this dataset aims to enable researchers, audio developers and sound designers to optimise and extend procedural audio applications. 

We are releasing 6,000 synthetic samples as a public dataset, a total of 2.56 GB and divided into  30 categories each one containing 100 samples . Each sample is named in the following format:

"Name of the sound category" - "Sample number" - "Label"
